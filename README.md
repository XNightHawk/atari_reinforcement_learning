# Rainbow DQN on Atari games

We use the Rainbow DQN model to build agents that play Ms-Pacman, Atlantis and Demon Attack. We make modifications to the model that allow much faster convergence on Ms-Pacman with respect to Deepmind's [original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.02298.pdf) and obtain comparable performance.
